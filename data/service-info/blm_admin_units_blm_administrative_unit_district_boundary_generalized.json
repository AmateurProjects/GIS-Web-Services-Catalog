    "subject": "This dataset has been generalized in an effort to meet program performance requests and/or requirements within a feature service. The generalized geometry may not reflect the original data perfectly and should be taken into account when running certain analysis types. Changes to the current generalized process are ongoing and this service should not be considered final. This dataset captures and establishes the geographic areas in which the organizational units of the BLM have distinct jurisdictional responsibility for land and resource management activities occurring on the public lands, the maintained rights of the United States (i.e. mineral estate) and actions relating to the Trust responsibilities of the U.S. Government as stipulated in Law or Treaty.  Particularly, this data pertains to the following BLM groups and their purposes: BLM State, District, and Field Office Personnel; most programs and national applications within the BLM; other agencies and the public.",
