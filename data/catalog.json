      "description": "Many of the BLM National Datasets cannot be taken offline due to the number of vertices in the dataset. In addition, displaying the data using a Feature Service crashes ArcGIS Server due to complex geometries (ie Godzilla polygons). As a result, it became imperative to generalize the Feature Classes so that they can be used in a Feature Service as well as being taken offline.\nUsing configuration settings, the user may choose between using a Smoothing algorithm or Simplification algorithm to perform generalization. \nDocumentation on the Smoothing algorithm can be found here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/cartography/smooth-polygon.htm\nDocumentation on the Simplification algorithm can be found here: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/tool-reference/cartography/simplify-polygon.htm\nNote: At the time of this writing, only polygon smoothing/simplification is tested. However, Linear datasets are also supported (FEATURE_TYPE)\n*Each of the features were generalized except for the labels (anno) and the point feature class in the admu blm webpub dataset. To keep the naming convention the same, we added the _gen after each feature class so this service and the data layers won’t get confused with the other admu services. This service and the underlying data will be kept “in-sync” with national replication. \n\nThis feature class is the Other Office level data from the feature level Dataset for the BLM Administrative Unit Boundaries Data Standard. The feature dataset includes both BLM administrative land areas and office locations. Land areas are depicted with polygons for the smallest administrative unit (field offices). Larger administrative units, such as district offices, and administrative states may be derived from these polygons. Office locations at each level are depicted with points.\n\nThis dataset is a subset of the official national dataset, containing features and attributes intended for public release and has been optimized for online map service performance. The Schema Workbook represents the official national dataset from which this dataset was derived.",

      "description": "This data set represents the extent, approximate location and type of riparian habitats in the western United States. These data delineate the areal extent of riparian habitats as defined by A System For Mapping Riparian Areas in the United States (USFWS 2009). Certain riparian habitats may be excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect riparian habitats.  This dataset should be used in conjuction with the Riparian Mapping Areas layer, which identifies the extent and location of Riparian mapping projects.\n \nThe present goal of the Service is to provide the citizens of the United States and its Trust Territories with current geospatially referenced information on the status, extent, characteristics and functions of wetlands, riparian, deepwater and related aquatic habitats in priority areas to promote the understanding and conservation of these resources.\n\nThe riparian maps were produced as topical overlays using U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps as the base. The hard copy product is a composite map showing topographic and planimetric features from the USGS map base and riparian habitats from the Service's topical overlay. Thus, the data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:24,000 or smaller. Due to the scale, the primary intended use is for regional and watershed data display and analysis, rather than specific project data analysis. The map products were neither designed or intended to represent legal or regulatory products. Questions or comments regarding the interpretation or classification of riparian habitats can be addressed by visiting http://www.fws.gov/wetlands/FAQs.html. These data were developed in conjunction with the publication; A System For Mapping Riparian Areas in the United States (USFWS 2009). These spatial data are not designed to stand alone. They form topical overlays to the U.S. Geological Survey 1:24,000 or 1:25,000 scale topographic quadrangles. These data will also work with current available digital wetlands data. Note that riparian delineations were drawn to follow the extent of riparian features described by this project and may not match surface features shown on other base maps.\n\nDue to the quantity and complexity of the riparian data the riparian data only display at 1:250,000 scale and greater.

      "description": "Abstract:\nThe National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.  NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.  Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information.\nPurpose:\nThe NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.",

This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.  Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information.\nPurpose:\nThe NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.",

      "description": "Abstract:\nThe National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) is a feature-based database that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water drainage system.  NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country. This high-resolution NHD, generally developed at 1:24,000/1:12,000 scale, adds detail to the original 1:100,000-scale NHD. (Data for Alaska, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands was developed at high-resolution, not 1:100,000 scale.) Local resolution NHD is being developed where partners and data exist. The NHD contains reach codes for networked features, flow direction, names, and centerline representations for areal water bodies. Reaches are also defined on waterbodies and the approximate shorelines of the Great Lakes, the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the Gulf of Mexico. The NHD also incorporates the National Spatial Data Infrastructure framework criteria established by the Federal Geographic Data Committee.  Use the metadata link, http://nhdgeo.usgs.gov/metadata/nhd_high.htm, for additional information.\nPurpose:\nThe NHD is a national framework for assigning reach addresses to water-related entities, such as industrial discharges, drinking water supplies, fish habitat areas, wild and scenic rivers. Reach addresses establish the locations of these entities relative to one another within the NHD surface water drainage network, much like addresses on streets. Once linked to the NHD by their reach addresses, the upstream/downstream relationships of these water-related entities--and any associated information about them--can be analyzed using software tools ranging from spreadsheets to geographic information systems (GIS). GIS can also be used to combine NHD-based network analysis with other data layers, such as soils, land use and population, to help understand and display their respective effects upon one another. Furthermore, because the NHD provides a nationally consistent framework for addressing and analysis, water-related information linked to reach addresses by one organization (national, state, local) can be shared with other organizations and easily integrated into many different types of applications to the benefit of all.",

      "description": "The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) is a comprehensive aggregated collection of hydrologic unit data consistent with the national criteria for delineation and resolution. It defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point except in coastal or lake front areas where there could be multiple outlets as stated by the \"Federal Standards and Procedures for the National Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD)\" “Standard” (http://pubs.usgs.gov/tm/11/a3/). Watershed boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. This dataset represents the hydrologic unit boundaries to the 12-digit (6th level) for the entire United States. Some areas may also include additional subdivisions representing the 14- and 16-digit hydrologic unit (HU). At a minimum, the HUs are delineated at 1:24,000-scale in the conterminous United States, 1:25,000-scale in Hawaii, Pacific basin and the Caribbean, and 1:63,360-scale in Alaska, meeting the National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Higher resolution boundaries are being developed where partners and data exist and will be incorporated back into the WBD. WBD data are delivered as a dataset of polygons and corresponding lines that define the boundary of the polygon. WBD polygon attributes include hydrologic unit codes (HUC), size (in the form of acres and square kilometers), name, downstream hydrologic unit code, type of watershed, non-contributing areas, and flow modifications. The HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. WBD line attributes contain the highest level of hydrologic unit for each boundary, line source information and flow modifications.",
